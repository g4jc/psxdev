<h1>
CD-Writer settings</h1>
If you want to write a CD as a normal user, make sure you have the right
to <b>access the CD writer</b>. This can be done in several ways:
<ul>
<li>
run <b>PSXDEV&nbsp;CD Maker</b> as root (<font color="#FF0000">not recommended!</font>)</li>

<li>
set the SUID&nbsp;bit on the <b>CDRDAO</b>&nbsp;executable</li>

<li>
give ownership of the CD writer device node to a new group (i.e. <i>cdwriter</i>)
and add yourself to this group (<font color="#009900">recommened!</font>)</li>
</ul>

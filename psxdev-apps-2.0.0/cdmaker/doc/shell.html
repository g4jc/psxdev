<h1>
Shell input/output</h1>

<h2>
Shell Window</h2>
All subprocesses of <i>PSXDEV&nbsp;CD Maker</i> are real subprocesses and
are running concurrently to the main application. All their shell output
is collected in <a href="tab:6">this</a> terminal emulation. You have a
huge scrollback buffer to analyse the command output and the possibility
to interact with a command (like pressing <b>CTRL-C</b> to abort it!).
<h2>
Process management</h2>
Once the <b>Master</b> or <b>Write</b> button was pressed, the shell is
busy processing a shell command (mkisofs or cdrdao). During this time you
can still work with the complete application, but the above mentioned buttons
are ghosted as long a shell process is working. If you launched a process
by mistake, simply press <b>CTRL-C</b> to abort it! If a shell process
is still running while you are quitting the application, the subprocess
is immediately killed. If you like some Ok/Cancel dialog boxes before each
operation, please let me know.

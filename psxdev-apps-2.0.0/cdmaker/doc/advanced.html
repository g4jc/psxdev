<h2>
Getting More Informations</h2>
This is only a quick and incomplete documentation, you definitly should
read and study the following manual resources:
<ul>
<li>
<a href="man:cdrdao">CDRDAO</a>&nbsp;man page</li>

<li>
<a href="man:mkisofs">MKISOFS</a>&nbsp;man page</li>

<li>
<a href="man:cdrecord">CDRECORD</a>&nbsp;man page</li>
</ul>

<h2>
File placement</h2>
All files are written alphabetically sorted to the master image, so a file
named <b>ZZZZZZZZ.ZZZ;1</b> would be the last file written to the image.
If file placement matters, you can control it with the filenames.
<h2>
Creating a bootable disc</h2>
This is a problematic section. An original PlayStation rejects to boot
unlicensed, non-black CD-ROM medias, so you need a developer PlayStation
like the black NetYaroze station. I can't help you here if you are using
a gray or white end user PlayStation, sorry.
<h2>
Avoiding laser seek problems</h2>
To avoid laser seek problems, you should always include a dummy file at
the end of your data track, which is at least three minutes long. Many
games have a <b>DUMMY.DAT;1</b> which is located at the end of the data
track, and I encountered seek problems when mastering too small data tracks.
To be sure, create a three minute long (~64MB) dummy file at the end of
the data track (just name it ZZZZZZZZ.ZZZ;1).
<h2>
Temporary files</h2>
The master process writes an image named <b>image.iso</b> (the name can
be changed <a href="tab:7">here</a>) into the <a href="tab:1">output path</a>
directory, and the write process creates a TOC&nbsp;description file named
<b>image.toc</b> (can also be changed <a href="tab:7">here</a>)&nbsp;in
the same location. These files are not deleted, you have to delete them
manually!
<h2>
Saving the settings</h2>
Settings are always written to the current directory (the directory where
the application was started from) into a file named .<b>psxcdmakerrc</b>.
This is a textfile with human readable options, but it is not recommended
to edit this file.

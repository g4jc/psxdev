<h1>
Tutorial</h1>
This small tutorial should help you understanding this application.
<h2>
Preparation of your input files</h2>
PSXDEV&nbsp;CD&nbsp;Maker uses a master directory to create an ISO&nbsp;image
from it, so you have to populate a directory with files. All these files
should already fulfill some&nbsp;limitations, which are
<ul>
<li>
all filenames must be <b>lowercase</b></li>

<li>
all filenames must be 8+3 (<b>filename.dat</b>)</li>

<li>
a maximum of <b>30 files</b> per directory (including directories)</li>

<li>
a maximum of <b>45 directories</b> per disc</li>
</ul>

<h2>
Mastering an image</h2>
If your master directory is filled with files, ensure they are fulfilling
the above limitations (there is currently no check option in this application).
Fill out all the register cards regarding the image, which are <a href="tab:1">Paths</a>,
<a href="tab:2">ISO9660</a>, <a href="tab:3">PSX</a> and <a href="tab:4">Audio</a>.
Make sure your input path points to your master directory and that it does
not use more than 660MB (use the disk usage button). Make sure your output
path points to a user writable directory with at least 660MB free disk
space (look at the gauge). Now press the Master button and analyse the
process output. If you find error messages here you have to correct them
first before proceeding to the write process!
<h2>
Writing an image</h2>
The master process did not waste your CD recordables, but this process
can. So you should always test this process with the simulate option! Please
study the CDRDAO&nbsp;documentation to understand all the options in the
<a href="tab:5">CD-Writer</a> register card. Press the Write button to
start the write process.

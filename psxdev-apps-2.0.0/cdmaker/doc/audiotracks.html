<h1>
Setting up the directory paths</h1>

<h2>
Input path</h2>
The input path points to the directory which holds the content for the
CD-ROM to be created. All files in this directory are written to the root
directory of the new CD-ROM. If you want to exclude files you can do that
with the exclude pattern in the <b>Data Track Section.</b>
<h2>
Checking the disk usage</h2>
To determine the disk space used by a selected directory, just click the
<b>Disk Usage</b> button. The calculated size will be displayed relative
to a virtual 700MB CD-ROM in the fuel gauge near the button.
<h2>
Output path</h2>
This path points to a directory with at least as much free space as an
ISO image would need (typically ~700MB). The temporary TOC file is written
to this directory and the image file itself. If you are using the on the
fly mode you need only a few KB for the TOC file as no data images are
created (data is piped directly to the CD writer).

<h1>
Basics of a PSX CD-ROM</h1>

<h2>
General</h2>
All informations provided here are guessed and not offical, so keep this
in mind. I made some test series to find it out (try and error...)
<h2>
Filesystem</h2>
The PSX&nbsp;seems to use a standard ISO&nbsp;9660 level 1 filesystem (8+3
names plus version suffix <b>;1</b>). The ISO&nbsp;filesystem implies a
maximum directory depth of 8 levels, and it seems that the total number
of directories and files on one disc is limited too (it uses only one sector
to store this information).
<ul>
<li>
up to 45 directories</li>

<li>
up to 30 files per directory</li>

<li>
maximum directory depth is 8 levels</li>

<li>
filenames must conform 8+3 notation plus version suffix</li>
</ul>

<h2>
CD-ROM&nbsp;Track types</h2>
The first track must always be a data track. Since you may want to embed
XA&nbsp;files (which take <b>2336 bytes/sector</b>) the data track should
be of type <b>CD_ROM_XA</b>. See below for more informations on XA&nbsp;files.
All following tracks can only be audio tracks, and a typical maximum of
99 tracks in total is supported.
<h2>
Embedding a product license</h2>
The system area of a PSX&nbsp;CD-ROM (the first 16 sectors) contains kind
of a product license. I&nbsp;you have such a license file, you can embed
it these sectors.
<h2>
Embedding XA&nbsp;streams</h2>
Two file types are supported by <i>PSXDEV&nbsp;CD Maker</i>:
<ul>
<li>
Mode 2 Form 1 (Used for all normal files)</li>

<ul>
<li>
8 Bytes Subheader</li>

<li>
2048 Bytes Data</li>

<li>
4 Bytes EDC</li>

<li>
276 Bytes ECC</li>
</ul>

<li>
Mode 2 Form 2 (Used for all XA&nbsp;files)</li>

<ul>
<li>
8 Bytes Subheader</li>

<li>
2324 Bytes Data</li>

<li>
4 Bytes Reserved</li>
</ul>
</ul>
You can specify filename filters to select the files to be embedded in
XA&nbsp;mode, like <b>*.xa</b>. It is up to you how you create the XA&nbsp;files;&nbsp;I've
tested this feature by using some existing XA&nbsp;files (audio files and
movies), creating a CD-ROM and replaying them with the help of the CAETLA&nbsp;movie
player. There are many details missing yet (like indexing, owner groups
and some sync informations) and since I do not have enough informations
about this they won't be implemented in the near future.

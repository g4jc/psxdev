<h2>
ISO 9660 filesystem</h2>
Refer to an ISO&nbsp;9660 filesystem documentation first, then fill out
the fields. It is important that the application ID&nbsp;and the system
ID&nbsp;are uppercase <b>PLAYSTATION</b>.
<h2>
Information files</h2>
These files are completely optional and are rarely used. You can specify
some files on the volume to be created, please refer to an ISO&nbsp;9660
documentation for more details.
<h2>
Miscellaneous</h2>
The only currently supported option is <b>Follow Symbolic Links</b>. If
this option is set all links are followed and the original content is written.
So you could soft link all files into one directory with this option and
the real files will be written. If not set all links will be ignored.
<p>All inactive options are currently disabled, because they would confuse
the user and could lead to incorrect mastered images if set by mistake.

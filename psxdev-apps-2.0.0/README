 PSXDEV is a free, GPL'd development environment for the Sony PlayStation
 aka PSX. It consists of a collection of utitiles, a patched GNU egcs compiler,
 patched GNU binutils, a device driver (kernel module) and data converters.
 It requires a PC commslink package, an ActionReplay with the CAETLA PS/PAR
 replacement firmware and of course a PSX. It does not include the required
 development libraries, includes and documentation - see documentation why.

 It allows you to up- and download main memory, video memory and memory card
 contents. Besides that, it's a full remote-target cross-compiling development
 environment hosted under unix. A remote PSX application can use the unix host
 as a file server and standard input/output can also be redirected. The kernel
 device driver has a simple API and support libraries; this makes it very easy
 to write special video game development applications like graphic editors,
 which for example can directly communicate with the target system.

 PSXDEV is not a SCEI product and has no relations to SCEI, is not supported
 by SCEI and was not developed by SCEI.
